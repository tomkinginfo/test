# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
name: AWS Codedeploy # <--- 修改此 workflow 名稱

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ] # <-- 修改成主要的 branch

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  # workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  deployment:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
     # Step 1 設定 AWS 的認證資訊
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1

          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}

     # Step 2 建立 AWS 的 Deploy
